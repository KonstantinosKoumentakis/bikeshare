Bikeshare companies need to stay up to date on rental trends to know where they should add new facilities, and how to reposition bikes to get them to the locations with the highest demand. They do not want to wait until all of the bikes are rented at a particular location before moving additional bikes into position, as that is lost revenue for them."

You are not going to have to learn any new concepts in this chapter, you are just learning some new query syntax that will open up whole new worlds of data access for you. Most businesses run on a relational database of some kind, so it follows that a lot of real world data analysis requires you to get data from one. In this section we will teach you how to get started."
